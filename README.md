## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This being our first ever hackathon project, was really a good learning experience for us. The time constraint was bit pressuring for us considering it is our first time

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Install xampp for PHP and mySQL
Create a table called users in mySQL
using:
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `username` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(100) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Run the apache server
Run the mySQL server
```
